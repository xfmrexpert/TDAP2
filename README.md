# TDAP2
This repository contains very early work on a transformer design analysis program similar in capability to Andersen's FLD12.  My current intent is to use this as a prototyping platform for my PhD dissertation work.  I began this work many, many years ago and fiddled with it here and there, but have finally gotten around to resurrecting it with more modern compilers, etc.  The GUI is written with Avalonia, since it is cross-platform, but similar to WPF.  Some of the code is written in C# for rapid prototyping and to allow for easy GUI development.  The FEM code is currently some code I wrote nearly 20yrs ago.  It is the weakest link in this whole endeavor.  I'll likely replace it with something based on the more robust and capable MFEM code.  If you see something stupid and want to let me know, feel free to email me at tcraymond@xfmrexpert.com.  Obviously, this is not anything that should be used for "real" work.  No warranties, or even claims that is does anything useful.
